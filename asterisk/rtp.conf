; RTP start and end ports (default: 10000-20000)
rtpstart=10000

; changes its RTP source port/address mid-call (common with NAT / VAD / some softphones).
strictrtp=no

; Enable ICE support (for NAT traversal)
;ice_support=yes

; Enable STUN support (for NAT traversal)
;stunaddr=stun.l.google.com:19302
